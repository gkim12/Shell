# Shell
Runs on Ubuntu 19.04. Supports most basic commands, including but not limited to *cd*, *mkdir*, *ls*, *rm*, *touch*, etc. 

Supports redirection *>* from terminal output to non-existent file and and advanced redirection *>+* which appends terminal output to start of given file. 

Added batch mode for easier scripting: batch mode takes in a .txt file with commands separated by **;** and executes them in order.
